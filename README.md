## Description/Component Structure

![](src/assets/imgs/chart.jpg)

This is the structure I will use to continue to develop my site. This chart displays component structure for the main homepage.

## Roadmap

This site is still under construction. I have implemented a model if one would like to update a beer list and have it display on the home page. Now that I have correctly implemented a stateful component, my next focus is on styling.

## Setup/Installation Requirements
