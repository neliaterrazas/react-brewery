## Description/Component Structure

![](src/assets/imgs/chart.jpg)

This is the structure I will use to continue to develop my site. This chart displays component structure for the main homepage.

## Roadmap

This site is still very static. My next goals are to replace location and events screenshots with functioning buttons and links to display more content. I am working on adding an admin path to update the current tap list.
